Meal tracker offers a mechanism to add food and calculate if you fall within your daily limits you set for protein, carbs and fats.

This is written in Java using Spring 4 MVC utilizing hibernate ORM to persist data to the database. I utilized bootstrap CSS framework to style the application with a little but of JQuery on the front end.

This was deployed to the cloud using RedHat Cloudshift and Git until that service was sunset.
